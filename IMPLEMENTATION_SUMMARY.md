# Hybrid Boundary Expansion - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A smart selection intent detection system that provides:
- **Automatic expansion** for partial selections (e.g., word → sentence)
- **Exact respect** for intentional full selections (e.g., complete paragraph)

## Key Files

1. **`src/lib/utils/sentenceBoundary.ts`** - Core intent detection logic (141 lines added)
2. **`src/routes/read/[id].tsx`** - Integration into inline edit activation (30 lines modified)
3. **`src/lib/utils/__tests__/sentenceBoundary.test.ts`** - Comprehensive test suite (195 lines, 20 tests)

## How It Works

### Selection Analysis

The system analyzes selections based on:
1. **Length**: < 20 chars (expand) vs > 200 chars (respect) vs 20-200 (check boundaries)
2. **Boundary Alignment**: Are both start and end at natural text boundaries?

### Decision Logic

```
IF selection < 20 characters:
  → EXPAND (user wants help)

ELSE IF selection > 200 characters:
  → RESPECT (clearly intentional)

ELSE IF selection 20-200 characters:
  IF both boundaries aligned AND length > 30:
    → RESPECT (complete unit)
  ELSE:
    → EXPAND (partial selection)

DEFAULT:
  → EXPAND (err on side of helping user)
```

## Thresholds

- **< 20 chars**: Always expand (typical words/phrases)
- **> 200 chars**: Always respect (deliberate large selections)
- **30-200 chars + aligned**: Respect (complete sentences)
- **20-30 chars or unaligned**: Expand (partial selections)

## Boundary Detection

Recognizes these as natural boundaries:
- Sentence endings: `.!?` (excluding abbreviations like "Dr.")
- Paragraph breaks: `\n\n`
- Document start/end
- List items (after newline + marker)

## Test Results

✓ All 20 tests pass
✓ TypeScript compilation successful
✓ No runtime errors

### Test Coverage

- Small selections (< 20 chars) → 3 tests
- Large selections (> 200 chars) → 2 tests
- Medium selections with boundaries → 5 tests
- Edge cases → 4 tests
- Integration workflows → 6 tests

## Usage

No changes required to existing code. The system automatically activates when users:
1. Select text in reading view
2. Press Ctrl+E or click "Inline Edit" in toolbar
3. System analyzes selection and applies appropriate behavior

## Console Debugging

Enable developer console to see:
- `[ReadPage] Respecting exact user selection:` - when respecting
- `[ReadPage] Expanding partial selection to boundaries:` - when expanding
- Details about selection length, boundary type, and text preview

## Verification

To verify the implementation works:
1. See `MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for 10 test scenarios
2. Run unit tests: `npx vitest run src/lib/utils/__tests__/sentenceBoundary.test.ts`
3. Check TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit`
