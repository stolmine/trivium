  - Impact: Wrong progress for excluded sections with Unicode/emoji
  - Solution: Changed to `.encode_utf16().count()` to match JavaScript `.length`
  - Files: `src-tauri/src/services/parser.rs:124`
  - Status: ✅ Complete

- ✅ **Bug Fix 2: Header Character Counting** (HIGH severity) - FIXED
  - Issue: Regex byte positions used directly instead of UTF-16 positions
  - Impact: Wrong progress for headers containing Unicode/emoji
  - Solution: Added `byte_offset_to_utf16_offset()` helper function to convert positions
  - Files: `src-tauri/src/services/parser.rs:138-159`
  - Status: ✅ Complete

- ✅ **Bug Fix 3: Paragraph Detection** (HIGH severity) - FIXED
  - Issue: Mixed byte positions with character counts causing wrong boundaries
  - Impact: Wrong paragraph navigation for Unicode text
  - Solution: Refactored to use `Vec<u16>` approach with UTF-16 code unit indices throughout
  - Files: `src-tauri/src/services/parser.rs:28-91`
  - Status: ✅ Complete

- ✅ **Bug 4: UTF-16/Unicode Position Mismatch** (MEDIUM severity) - FIXED!
  - Issue: Frontend uses UTF-16 code units (emoji = 2), backend used Unicode scalars (emoji = 1)
  - Impact: 1-position offset per emoji before selection point
  - Solution: Converted ALL backend character counting to UTF-16 code units (`.encode_utf16().count()`)
  - Files:
    - `src-tauri/src/commands/texts.rs:28` (content_length)
    - `src-tauri/src/services/parser.rs` (all character counting functions)
  - Testing: 11 new UTF-16 tests added, all passing (emoji, CJK, mixed Unicode)
  - Status: ✅ Complete

- ✅ Added `byte_offset_to_utf16_offset()` helper for regex position conversion (Bug 2)
- ✅ Refactored `detect_paragraphs()` to use `Vec<u16>` for UTF-16 code unit positions (Bug 3)
- ✅ Fixed `detect_header_ranges()` to convert byte positions to UTF-16 positions (Bug 2)
- ✅ Fixed `create_text` command content_length to use UTF-16 counting (Bug 4)
- ✅ **All character counting now uses `.encode_utf16().count()` throughout backend** (Bug 4)
- ✅ Enhanced Wikipedia service with reference stripping and bold headers
- ✅ Updated parser service with consistent character (not byte) position handling

**Frontend Changes**:
- ✅ Enhanced card preview with better context extraction
- ✅ Improved error handling and loading states
- ✅ Updated documentation references throughout codebase

**Testing Status**:
- ✅ Backend: Compiles successfully with all Unicode fixes
- ✅ Frontend: TypeScript compilation successful
- ⚠️ Testing Gap: No automated tests yet for Unicode bug fixes (Bugs 1-3)
- ⚠️ Recommended: Add tests for emoji, Chinese/Japanese, Arabic text with the fixed functions

**Success Criteria Met**:
- ✅ Card previews show complete sentences with proper context
- ✅ Unicode bugs 1-3 fixed (excluded chars, headers, paragraphs)
- ✅ Character positions now use `.chars().count()` consistently (not `.len()` bytes)
- ✅ Wikipedia articles parse cleanly without reference numbers
- ✅ Progress tracking more accurate for Unicode text (3 of 4 bugs fixed)
- ✅ No regression in existing features
- ✅ Backend compiles without errors
- ✅ Frontend TypeScript passes
- ⚠️ Bug 4 (UTF-16 mismatch) deferred to future phase

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Character position handling now uses Unicode scalar values via `.chars().count()`
- Byte-to-character position conversion added for regex matches
- Paragraph detection refactored to use `Vec<char>` for clean character indexing
- Remaining issue: Frontend UTF-16 vs Backend Unicode scalar mismatch (only affects emoji)
- Wikipedia parser uses CSS selectors to strip .reference elements
- All position-based calculations now consistent with `content_length` calculation

**Files Modified**:
- Backend:
  - `src-tauri/src/services/parser.rs` (fixed 3 Unicode bugs in character counting)
  - `src-tauri/src/services/wikipedia.rs` (reference stripping, bold headers)

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Known Bugs (Fixed in Phase 6)
- ✅ **FIXED**: Library tree not refreshing after folder creation
  - **Issue**: Adding a folder via sidebar context menu didn't update the tree display
  - **Cause**: `buildTree` was not wrapped in `useMemo` with proper dependencies
  - **Fix**: Added `useMemo` with `[folders, sortedTexts]` dependencies in LibraryTree.tsx
  - **Status**: Fixed in branch `5_reviewFilter`

- ✅ **FIXED**: NaN values displayed in review hub and library page
  - **Issue**: Stats showed "NaN cards due" instead of numbers
  - **Cause**: Missing null coalescing when accessing potentially undefined stats properties
  - **Fix**: Added `?? 0` fallback operators throughout review hub and library stats display
  - **Status**: Fixed in branch `5_reviewFilter`

- ✅ **FIXED**: "Error loading library" when adding folders
  - **Issue**: Adding folders caused error state that hid entire library
  - **Root Causes**:
    1. Error state persistence in frontend (set global error instead of throwing)
    2. Missing `folderId` field in TypeScript Text interface
    3. Database schema mismatch (folders/texts `folder_id` type inconsistency)
    4. Text model `source` field was non-nullable but database schema allowed NULL
  - **Fixes Applied**:
    - Changed folder operations to throw errors instead of setting global state
    - Added `folderId?: string | null` to Text interface
    - Fixed database migrations to use TEXT for folder IDs (UUID support)
    - Changed Text struct `source` field from `String` to `Option<String>`
  - **Status**: Fixed, Rust compilation successful

- ✅ **FIXED**: Review hub shows 0 cards due despite new cards existing
  - **Issue**: Due cards not detected even when newly created
  - **Root Cause**: SQLite string comparison instead of datetime comparison in queries
    - Cards stored with RFC3339 format: `"2025-10-15T05:52:05.201764+00:00"`
    - Query used `WHERE due <= ?` (lexicographic string comparison fails)
  - **Fix**: Updated all datetime comparisons to use `datetime()` function:
    - Changed to `WHERE datetime(due) <= datetime(?)` in 10+ queries
    - Updated in `get_due_cards`, `get_review_stats`, and all filtered variants
  - **Files Modified**: `src-tauri/src/commands/review.rs`
  - **Status**: Fixed, due cards now correctly detected

- ✅ **FIXED**: Text options missing in read view
  - **Issue**: No UI controls to rename or delete texts when viewing them
  - **Root Cause**: Read page had no text management options
  - **Fix**: Added dropdown menu with:
    - Rename option with dialog (keyboard: Enter to confirm)
    - Delete option with confirmation (warns about flashcard deletion)
    - Three-dot menu icon in header
    - Full keyboard and mouse access
  - **Files Modified**: `src/routes/read/[id].tsx`
  - **Status**: Fixed, text management fully functional

- ✅ **FIXED**: Review hub only accessible when cards due
  - **Issue**: No way to access review hub without due cards on dashboard
  - **Root Cause**: Review hub locked behind conditional dashboard card
  - **Fix**: Added permanent sidebar navigation:
    - "Review" item with GraduationCap icon
    - Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+3` (or `Cmd+3` on Mac)
    - Always visible regardless of due cards
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/components/shell/Sidebar.tsx`
    - `src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`
  - **Status**: Fixed, always accessible from sidebar

- ✅ **FIXED**: Thread panic on startup - "migration was previously applied but has been modified"
  - **Issue**: Application crashed with migration checksum mismatch error
  - **Root Cause**: Migration files modified after being applied to databases
    - SQLx uses SHA-384 checksums to detect tampering
    - Checksums in `_sqlx_migrations` table didn't match current files
    - Both production and dev databases affected
  - **Fix**: Updated migration checksums in both databases:
    - Computed current SHA-384 checksums for all three migrations
    - Backed up both databases before changes
    - Updated checksums in `_sqlx_migrations` table via SQL
    - Verified application startup successful
    - Committed migration files to Git
  - **Prevention**: Created SQLx best practices guide (see SQLX_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
  - **Key Learning**: Never modify migrations after they're applied - always create new ones
  - **Status**: Fixed, app starts cleanly without errors

- ✅ **FIXED**: Text dropdown shows blank after selection
  - **Issue**: Text selection dropdown in review config showed nothing after selecting a text
  - **Root Cause**: SelectValue component not displaying custom content for selected text
    - Same issue as folder dropdown had initially
    - Missing getTextName() helper function
  - **Fix**: Applied same pattern as folder dropdown:
    - Added getTextName() helper to lookup text title from ID
    - Modified SelectValue to display text name using children prop
  - **Files Modified**: `src/routes/review/index.tsx`
  - **Status**: Fixed, text dropdown now shows human-readable titles

- ✅ **FIXED**: Cyclical folder_id type mismatch causing compilation/runtime failures
  - **Issue**: folder_id field kept being changed between `Option<i64>` and `Option<String>`, causing cyclical failures
    - Changing to `Option<i64>` → compiles but breaks runtime (folders.id is TEXT/UUID)
    - Changing to `Option<String>` → fixes runtime but breaks compile (SQLx saw INTEGER in schema)
  - **Root Cause**: Phantom migration records - migrations marked as "applied" but never executed
    - Migration 20251015000002 should have changed `folder_id` from INTEGER → TEXT
    - Migration record was manually inserted into `_sqlx_migrations` table
    - Actual database schema remained as `folder_id INTEGER`
    - SQLx compile-time checking correctly detected the type mismatch
  - **Fix**: Properly executed the phantom migrations:
    - Deleted phantom migration records from `_sqlx_migrations` table
    - Re-ran migrations 20251015000001-002 with `cargo sqlx migrate run`
    - Schema now correctly shows `folder_id TEXT` (matches folders.id UUID format)
    - Regenerated SQLx offline cache with `cargo sqlx prepare`
    - Added comprehensive documentation to Text.folder_id field explaining type requirements
  - **Prevention**:
    - Documentation warns against changing to `Option<i64>`
    - Explains foreign key relationship: texts.folder_id (TEXT) → folders.id (TEXT)
    - References migration file for schema verification
    - SQLx offline cache now committed to prevent future mismatches
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src-tauri/src/models/text.rs` (added documentation)
    - Database schema (folder_id INTEGER → TEXT via migrations)
    - `.sqlx/` cache directory (regenerated with correct types)
  - **Commits**: `54fbc85` - Fix folder_id type mismatch permanently
  - **Status**: Fixed permanently with documentation to prevent recurrence

### Database
- ✅ FSRS crate dependency conflict resolved via manual implementation
  - **Resolution**: Implemented FSRS-5 algorithm manually in Rust
  - **Status**: Complete and working in Phase 3

### Frontend
- ✅ No significant issues - production ready
- ✅ Context menu implemented with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Clean, optimized code with debug logging removed
- ✅ Proper null safety with TypeScript's optional chaining

### Backend
- ℹ️ One unused public API method warning (`get_unread_ranges` in RangeCalculator)
  - This is part of public API for future use - expected warning
- ✅ All commands working correctly with proper parameter naming
