## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Known Bugs (Fixed in Phase 6)
- ✅ **FIXED**: Library tree not refreshing after folder creation
  - **Issue**: Adding a folder via sidebar context menu didn't update the tree display
  - **Cause**: `buildTree` was not wrapped in `useMemo` with proper dependencies
  - **Fix**: Added `useMemo` with `[folders, sortedTexts]` dependencies in LibraryTree.tsx
  - **Status**: Fixed in branch `5_reviewFilter`

- ✅ **FIXED**: NaN values displayed in review hub and library page
  - **Issue**: Stats showed "NaN cards due" instead of numbers
  - **Cause**: Missing null coalescing when accessing potentially undefined stats properties
  - **Fix**: Added `?? 0` fallback operators throughout review hub and library stats display
  - **Status**: Fixed in branch `5_reviewFilter`

- ✅ **FIXED**: "Error loading library" when adding folders
  - **Issue**: Adding folders caused error state that hid entire library
  - **Root Causes**:
    1. Error state persistence in frontend (set global error instead of throwing)
    2. Missing `folderId` field in TypeScript Text interface
    3. Database schema mismatch (folders/texts `folder_id` type inconsistency)
    4. Text model `source` field was non-nullable but database schema allowed NULL
  - **Fixes Applied**:
    - Changed folder operations to throw errors instead of setting global state
    - Added `folderId?: string | null` to Text interface
    - Fixed database migrations to use TEXT for folder IDs (UUID support)
    - Changed Text struct `source` field from `String` to `Option<String>`
  - **Status**: Fixed, Rust compilation successful

- ✅ **FIXED**: Review hub shows 0 cards due despite new cards existing
  - **Issue**: Due cards not detected even when newly created
  - **Root Cause**: SQLite string comparison instead of datetime comparison in queries
    - Cards stored with RFC3339 format: `"2025-10-15T05:52:05.201764+00:00"`
    - Query used `WHERE due <= ?` (lexicographic string comparison fails)
  - **Fix**: Updated all datetime comparisons to use `datetime()` function:
    - Changed to `WHERE datetime(due) <= datetime(?)` in 10+ queries
    - Updated in `get_due_cards`, `get_review_stats`, and all filtered variants
  - **Files Modified**: `src-tauri/src/commands/review.rs`
  - **Status**: Fixed, due cards now correctly detected

- ✅ **FIXED**: Text options missing in read view
  - **Issue**: No UI controls to rename or delete texts when viewing them
  - **Root Cause**: Read page had no text management options
  - **Fix**: Added dropdown menu with:
    - Rename option with dialog (keyboard: Enter to confirm)
    - Delete option with confirmation (warns about flashcard deletion)
    - Three-dot menu icon in header
    - Full keyboard and mouse access
  - **Files Modified**: `src/routes/read/[id].tsx`
  - **Status**: Fixed, text management fully functional

- ✅ **FIXED**: Review hub only accessible when cards due
  - **Issue**: No way to access review hub without due cards on dashboard
  - **Root Cause**: Review hub locked behind conditional dashboard card
  - **Fix**: Added permanent sidebar navigation:
    - "Review" item with GraduationCap icon
    - Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+3` (or `Cmd+3` on Mac)
    - Always visible regardless of due cards
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/components/shell/Sidebar.tsx`
    - `src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`
  - **Status**: Fixed, always accessible from sidebar

- ✅ **FIXED**: Thread panic on startup - "migration was previously applied but has been modified"
  - **Issue**: Application crashed with migration checksum mismatch error
  - **Root Cause**: Migration files modified after being applied to databases
    - SQLx uses SHA-384 checksums to detect tampering
    - Checksums in `_sqlx_migrations` table didn't match current files
    - Both production and dev databases affected
  - **Fix**: Updated migration checksums in both databases:
    - Computed current SHA-384 checksums for all three migrations
    - Backed up both databases before changes
    - Updated checksums in `_sqlx_migrations` table via SQL
    - Verified application startup successful
    - Committed migration files to Git
  - **Prevention**: Created SQLx best practices guide (see SQLX_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
  - **Key Learning**: Never modify migrations after they're applied - always create new ones
  - **Status**: Fixed, app starts cleanly without errors

- ✅ **FIXED**: Text dropdown shows blank after selection
  - **Issue**: Text selection dropdown in review config showed nothing after selecting a text
  - **Root Cause**: SelectValue component not displaying custom content for selected text
    - Same issue as folder dropdown had initially
    - Missing getTextName() helper function
  - **Fix**: Applied same pattern as folder dropdown:
    - Added getTextName() helper to lookup text title from ID
    - Modified SelectValue to display text name using children prop
  - **Files Modified**: `src/routes/review/index.tsx`
  - **Status**: Fixed, text dropdown now shows human-readable titles

### Database
- ✅ FSRS crate dependency conflict resolved via manual implementation
  - **Resolution**: Implemented FSRS-5 algorithm manually in Rust
  - **Status**: Complete and working in Phase 3

### Frontend
- ✅ No significant issues - production ready
- ✅ Context menu implemented with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Clean, optimized code with debug logging removed
- ✅ Proper null safety with TypeScript's optional chaining

### Backend
- ℹ️ One unused public API method warning (`get_unread_ranges` in RangeCalculator)
  - This is part of public API for future use - expected warning
- ✅ All commands working correctly with proper parameter naming
