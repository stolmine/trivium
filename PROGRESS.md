## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Database
- ⚠️ FSRS crate has dependency conflict with SQLx (both link sqlite3)
  - **Impact**: Can't use FSRS crate directly
  - **Options**: Manual implementation, switch to rusqlite, or find compatible version
  - **Timeline**: Must resolve in Phase 3

### Frontend
- ℹ️ Some placeholder components have unused parameter warnings (not in implemented code)
- ℹ️ Context menu uses custom implementation (not Radix UI) due to npm issues

### Backend
- ℹ️ One unused public API method warning (`get_unread_ranges` in RangeCalculator)
  - This is part of public API for future use - expected warning
