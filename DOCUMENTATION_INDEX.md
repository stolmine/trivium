**Description**: Summary of debugging changes for read highlighting styling issue. Lists modifications to ReadHighlighter (logs, inline styles, data attributes), reading store (markRangeAsRead/getReadRanges logging), and ReadPage (state change logging). Explains what will be discovered: data flow issues, logic issues, and styling issues
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13

### `/Users/why/repos/trivium/BROWSER_CHECKLIST.md`

### `/Users/why/repos/trivium/TRIPLE_CLICK_AND_CLOZE_DEBUGGING.md`
**Description**: Comprehensive debugging documentation for triple-click paragraph selection and mark-as-read position calculation bugs. **Status: REVERTED** - Experimental refactor broke rendering. Fixed DOM position calculation using start + totalTextLength approach. Documents synthetic newline discovery, element offset semantics, sibling-walking logic, and boundary mismatch between DOM (rendered) and cleanedContent (markdown) position spaces. Core issue remains: visual highlight boundaries don't match exact selections due to position space conversion
